The weather box is a pixel generated map of svg squares that change color and animate based on the current weather. Enter the name of a city into the form and house and landscape will update to reflect that region's current weather. The local time will also impact the display.

When the weather is cold, the background gets progressively bluer and for warmer temperatures, it gets red.

Sixteen representations of weather are available, and some are animated in pure CSS! Stars twinkle, thunder claps, and snow swirls.
